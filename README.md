This is my first Unity game and my favorite game.
It is a 2D Topdown game I learnd Unity basics with game .
All code work ,design and  pixelarts done  and created by me.

## How to play
Try tyo survive as long as you can.

Kill enemies using your gun and dodge the bullets.You can heal using medkits.

Devils throws fireballs In version 1.1  I added skeletons and King Mob Skeleton hits melee and king explodes when it gets very close.


There is no escape in HELLLLL.


## Controls:
- **Movement**: W A S D
- **Dash** : Shift

## Versions
There are 2 versions (1.0 and 1.1) as I said this is my first game and because of that I want to develop it more. I added dashing , skeletons and king in game  you can easily pick a corner in map and camp in there   King chases you and explodes just like creepers   to avoids it.
